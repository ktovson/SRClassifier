CAN,Serial,"ONE QUICK QUESTION TO START OFF: MAX LISTS TWO CAN DEVICES UNDER DEVICES AND  INTERFACES, CAN0 AND CAN1, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE THE SAME.  (SEE ATTACHED IMAGE.)  WHEN I START THE CAN PROGRAMMING, WHICH DO I REFERENCE?  THE DEVICE IM COMMUNICATING WITH HAS BOTH RS-232 AND CAN COMMUNICATION INTERFACES.  NOT WITHOUT SOME STRUGGLE, I WAS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THEIR COMMAND REQUEST/RESPONSE PROTOCOL THROUGH THE RS-232 INTERFACE, AS I HAVE PAST FAMILIARITY WITH IT.  WRITING AND READING THE INDIVIDUAL STRING INFORMATION ENABLED ME TO SEE HOW THE COMMANDS HAD TO BE STRUCTURED SINCE THEIR INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY CLEAR.  I CAN NOW ACCESS ALL OF THE NEEDED PARAMETERS VIA RS-232, BUT WHAT THAT LACKS RELATIVE TO CAN IS SPEED (19,200 BAUD VS. 500,000 BPS).  SINCE WE ARE LOOKING TO CAPTURE ~200 INDIVIDUAL MEASUREMENTS EVERY FEW SECONDS, I HAVE TO MAKE THE TRANSITION INTO CAN.  THE MESSAGE STRUCTURE IS DIFFERENT FOR CAN, BUT THE PROTOCOL IS MUCH THE SAME. I SEND A REQUEST FOR A SPECIFIC PIECE OF INFORMATION, AND THE DEVICE SENDS A RESPONSE, ALTHOUGH IT IS ALSO BROADCASTING SEVERAL GENERAL PARAMETERS PERIODICALLY.  THE LABVIEW EXAMPLES AND TUTORIALS THAT I HAVE LOOKED AT ALL SEEM TO BE AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN WHERE I AM, AS I AM USED TO CREATING/SENDING AND RECEIVING/DECODING BINARY STRINGS, AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO THIS WITH CAN OR IF THAT IS THE WAY CAN WORKS.  THERE IS ALSO NO ESTABLISHED DATABASE OF PARAMETERS FOR THIS AS REFERENCED BY MANY OF THE EXAMPLES, ONLY A LIST OF COMMAND BYTES.  THE COMMAND SENT FROM THE HOST COMPUTER TO THE DEVICE STARTS WITH THE NORMAL CAN 11-BIT ID FIELD, WHICH WILL TAKE THE FORM 010 0000 0000 TO 010 0000 1111 (OR 0X200 TO 0X20F), DEPENDING ON THE SUBSYSTEM BEING ADDRESSED.  THE FOLLOWING RTR BIT WILL ALWAYS BE 0, AND THE DLC VALUE WILL SPECIFY 2 DATA BYTES TO FOLLOW: WHETHER CONTROLLER (0) OR SUBSYSTEM (1) REQUEST IN THE FIRST BYTE, AND THE INFORMATION REQUEST COMMAND IN THE SECOND BYTE.  THE RESPONSE WILL BE ALMOST A  DUPLICATE OF THE REQUEST, EXCEPT THAT THE INITIAL  2 WILL BECOME A 3 (SO 0X300 TO 0X30F), AND DLC WILL SPECIFY 4 BYTES WITH THE  EXTRA TWO CONTAINING THE RESPONSE DATA WORD.  IN SOME INSTANCES, THE DLC WILL  BE 6 OR 8 IF MORE FIELDS ARE PROVIDED.  THE REGULARLY BROADCAST DATA HAS THIS  STRUCTURE AS WELL.  AS AN EXAMPLE, IF I WANTED TO GET THE SYSTEM TEMPERATURE (COMMAND 0X08), I  WOULD SEND THE MESSAGE 0X200020008, AND EXPECT BACK THE MESSAGE 0X300040008740B  FOR A TEMPERATURE OF 20°C (0X0B74 = 2932; /10 = 293.2K; - 273.2 = 20°C)  THINKING OF ME AS A BABY TAKING HIS FIRST STEPS, CAN YOU POINT ME IN THE RIGHT  DIRECTION OF GETTING OVER THE INITIAL HURDLE OF IMPLEMENTING A DATA REQUEST AND  INTERPRETING THE RESPONSE WITH CAN?

DIAdem,DIAdem,"I AM LOOKING TO AUTOMATE DATA ANALYSIS AND NEED HELP.  WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED AN INSTRUMENT THAT TRAPS SINGLE IONS.

THERE ARE TWO SETS OF PREAMPS, ONE FOR TUBES 1 AND 3, THE OTHER FOR TUBES 2 AND 4. AS AN ION TRAVERSES A TUBE, IT INDUCES A SIGNAL PROPORTIONAL TO ITS CHARGE.  THIS SIGNAL IS DIFFERENTIATED, RESULTING IN A SPIKE WHEN THE ION ENTERS THE TUBE, FOLLOWED BY A DIP WHEN IT EXITS.  THE DISTANCE FROM THE SPIKE TO THE VALLEY IS THE TIME IT TAKES THE ION TO TRAVERSE THE TUBE.  THIS VALUE, THE LENGTH OF THE TUBE AND THE VOLTAGE USED TO TRAP THE ION PROVIDES THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE ION.  THEN, USING THE CHARGE, MASS IS CALCULATED. BECAUSE THE ION IS TRAPPED, WE SAMPLE IT MANY TIMES.  WE END UP WITH TWO FILES FOR THE ION, ONE FOR TUBES 1 AND 3, THE OTHER FOR TUBES 2 AND 4.  THEY ARE RAW VOLTAGES, AND HAVE TO BE CONVERTED TO A PLOT OF VOLTAGE VS TIME.  THE VOLTAGE CAN THEN BE CONVERTED TO CHARGE THROUGH A CALIBRATION.

IMAQ,IMAQ,"WE ARE A NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS ALLIANCE PARTNER AND ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PROJECTS IS TO CREATE HIGH-TECH 3D LASER MICROSCOPES FOR THE HOWARD HUGHES MEDICAL INSTITUTE. THESE SYSTEMS USE SPECIAL MICROSCOPE CAMERAS FROM HAMAMATSU THAT ARE NOT STANDARD MACHINE VISION CAMERAS (NOT CAMERALINK, GIGE, USB3, ETC.)

CURRENTLY, WERE ONLY ACQUIRING ABOUT 600 FPS (LOW RES), ALTHOUGH THE CAMERAS COULD GO AS FAST AS 2000 FPS. THIS SYSTEM HAS ABOUT 120 GB OF RAM. IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE IMAGES THAT QUICKLY, WE DECIDED TO TRY CREATING A VERY LARGE RING BUFFER BY PREALLOCATING ABOUT 10000 IMAQ IMAGES.  PREALLOCATING THAT MANY IMAQ IMAGES TAKES A SURPRISINGLY LARGE ABOUT OF TIME (UP TO 5-10 MINUTES). WE RAN SOME PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS AND MADE SOME DISCOVERIES. THE TIME REQUIRED TO RUN THE IMAQ CREATE VI INCREASES LINEARLY WITH THE NUMBER OF IMAQ IMAGES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRST IMAQ IMAGE MAY ONLY TAKE 20 MICROSECONDS, BUT THE 1000TH IMAQ IMAGE NEEDED 10 MILLISECONDS. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IMAQ CREATE DOESNT ACTUALLY ALLOCATE MEMORY FOR THE IMAGE DATAIT ONLY RESERVES THE NAME FOR THAT IMAQ IMAGE OBJECT. OUR BELIEF IS THAT WHEN YOU CALL THE IMAQ IMAGE CREATE, IT SCANS THROUGH AN ARRAY OF STRING DATA THAT CONTAINS THE NAMES OF ALL OF THE OTHER IMAQ OBJECTS, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY IT TAKES MORE TIME AS THE LIST GETS LONGER. IN OTHER WORDS, IMAQ IS NOT USING HASH TABLES FOR RAPID DATABASE LOOKUP. IS THIS CORRECT?

IMAQ,RIO,"HELLO NI SUPPORT, I'D LIKE TO USE MY USB3 CAMERA/CRIO/VISION ACQUISITION SOFTWARE TO RECORD AND SAVE VIDEOS TO AN SD CARD IN MY NI 9802 MODULE. I WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS THROUGH A DMA CHANNEL DUE TO THE SUPERIOR DATA TRANSFER RATE. HOWEVER, TRANSFERRING OUR VIDEO DATA THROUGH A DMA CHANNEL MAY NOT BE NECESSARY, FOR WE DO NOT NEED TO SEE THE VIDEO IN REAL TIME ALONG WITH OUR ANALOG DATA VIA THE HOST PC. WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW A COUPLE OF THINGS: 1) IF WE RECORD VIDEO THORUHG OUR USB3 CAMERA THROUGH THE HOST.VI INSTEAD OF THE FPGA.VI, WOULD THE VIDEOS AND OUR ANALOG DATA HAVE THE SAME START TIME? AS IN WOULD THEY BE SYNCHRONIZED? IS THERE ANY DELAY CAUSED BY NEEDING TO ""MOUNT"" THE SD CARD ON THE HOST.VI? THE ANALOG DATA STARTS IMMEDIATELY, AS SOON AS WE RUN THE HOST.VI, AND WE ARE WONDERING IF THE VIDEOS WOULD TOO.  2) WHY AREN'T THE IMAQDX (OR ANY VAS BLOCKS) AVAILABLE ON THE FPGA.VI?  3) WOULD THE CORRECT MANNER TO SAVE VIDEOS THROUGH A DMA BE TO TRANSFER PIXEL DATA THROUGH THE DMA, THEN RECREATE THE IMAGES THROUGH THE PIXEL DATA ON THE HOST? IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO TRANSFER VIDEO FILES? 4) ARE ONLY FAT16 SD CARDS ACCEPTED BY THE NI 9802 MODULE? IS IT RECOMMENDED TO JUST GET A 2GB SD CARD INSTEAD OF TRYING TO PARTITION LARGER SD CARDS AND THEN FORMATING THE PARTITIONS TO FAT16? COULD THE MODULE EVEN READ THE PARTITIONS?  4.5) I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO USE A 4GB SD CARD (WHICH IS FAT32). IS THIS WHY I AM NOT GETTING A DRIVE LETTER THROUGH MY ""MOUNT SD CARD"" METHOD?

LabWindows_CVI,MultifunctionDAQ,"I HAVE A QUESTION CONCERNING DAQMX. I START A DAQMX TASK AND USE THE EVERYNSAMPLESCALLBACK TO PROCESS THE DATA. PROCESSING INCLUDES READING THE DATA (DAQ MXREADANALOGF64), STORING (TDMS_APPENDDATAVALUESMULTICHANNEL) AND OTHER VARIOUS FUNCTIONS SUCH AS CHECKING LIMITS AND SETTING CURRENTS WHEN RUNNING A CURRENT PULSING APPLICATION.

THESE TIME VALUES ARE DISPLAYED ON THE FRONT PANEL AS ELAPSED TIME.  WHAT I HAVE FOUND IS THAT THE TIME TO EXECUTE EVERYNSAMPLESCALLBACK MUST BE LESS THAN THE ACQUISITION TIME. I REALIZED THIS WHILE WATCHING THE ELAPSED TIME DISPLAY AND NOTICING IT WAS WAY BEHIND THE ACTUAL RUNTIME. TIMING THE EVERYNSAMPLESCALLBACK  I SAW THAT IT WAS OFTEN TAKING LONGER THAN THE ACQUISITION TIME.

WHEN USED AS A SERVICE, THE PROGRAM CALLS A FUNCTION IN THE CVI DLL THAT CLOSES THE THREADS AND IMMEDIATELY CRASHES.  THERE IS NO ERROR DISPLAYED OR POPUP MESSAGE THAT I CAN MENTION HERE.  EVERYTHING JUST CLOSES AND STOPS WORKING. WE ALSO HAVE SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND SOME RELAYS AND DIO CONTROL IN THE SAME CVI DLL.

FOR EXAMPLE, I SET A BOLEAN TO TRUE IN THE HOST VI AND PASS THAT VALUE TO THE FPGA VI TO RUN A TRUE ON THAT CONTROL.

RIO,RIO,"HI, I AM TRYING TO ACHIEVE SIMULTANEOUS OUTPUT ACROSS THREE DIFFERENT OUTPUT MODULES. I AM TRYING TO SEND A BOOLEAN VALUE TO BASICALLY TURN SWITCHES ON AND OFF AT THE SAME TIME (OR WITHIN NANOSECONDS OF EACH OTHER). MY HARDWARE SETUP CONSISTS OF AN NI CRIO-9024 ATTACHED TO A CRIO-9114 CHASSIS. THIS CHASSIS CONTAINS ONE NI 9402 MODULE USED TO OUTPUT A BOOLEAN SIGNAL. THIS CHASSIS IS THEN DAISY CHAINED TO AN NI 9144 ETHERCAT EXPANSION CHASSIS. THIS NI 9144 CHASSIS ALSO CONTAINS AN NI 9402 MODULE TO OUTPUT A BOOLEAN. THERE IS THEN A BECKHOFF EK1100 MODULE WITH A BECKHOFF EL2202 DIGITAL OUTPUT MODULE ATTACHED TO IT. THIS IS DAISY CHAINED TO THE NI 9144 CHASSIS. AN EXAMPLE PICTURE OF THIS CONFIGURATION IS ATTACHED IN THE PROJECT PICS FOLDER. ULTIMATELY I HAVE 3 VI'S TO RUN THIS OPERATION. THE 9114_FPGA AND 9144_FPGA VI'S ARE EMBEDDED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FPGA CHASSIS AND THEY ARE USED TO OUTPUT A SQUARE WAVE BY ALTERNATING A BOOLEAN VALUE BETWEEN TRUE AND FALSE. THE RT_HOST_&AMP;_BEK1100_CONTROL.VI IS USED TO OUTPUT A SQUARE WAVE TO THE BECKHOFF HARDWARE, AND ALSO CONTROL THE OTHER TWO FPGA VI'S.

ALL 3 OUTPUTS WERE CONNECTED TO AN OSCILLOSCOPE AND THE TIME BETWEEN OUTPUT FROM EACH MODULE WAS VERY LARGE. AROUND THE ORDER OF 10-30 MILLISECONDS. THIS IS SHOWN IN THE ATTACHED SCREEN GRAB PICTURE FROM THE OSCILLOSCOPE.

ScopesDigitizers,ScopesDigitizers,"I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SPEAKING TO AN APPLICATION ENGINEER, ANTHONY FULLER.  HERE IS THE EMAIL THAT I TRIED TO SEND HIM:I'VE HAD SOME TIME AND SUCCESS DOING SOME DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR DATA ACQUISITION.  THIS TDMS FILE VIEWER DID PROVIDE US A GOOD START, BTW.  MY COLLEAGUE IS DEVELOPING A VERY NICE LOOKING VIEWER (MUCH LIKE AN O'SCOPE) WHICH WILL EXTEND ON THAT FUNCTIONALITY.  I HAVE 2 CHASSIS THAT ARE GOING TO DO CONTINUOUS ACQUISITION.  EACH CHASSIS MAY HAVE MULTIPLE DIGITIZERS IN IT.  I HAVE ATTACHED A VI FILE.  THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT ALL OF MY DIGITIZER CAPTURE FILES LOOK LIKE.  IF I HAVE 4 DIGITIZERS ON 1 CHASSIS, THEN I WILL CREATE 4 INSTANCES OF THIS VI AND CONFIGURE IT FOR EACH DIGITIZER.  EACH FILE WILL BE SEPARATED INTO ITS ON TDMS FILE.  THIS LEADS TO PROBLEMS WITH SYNCHRONIZING ALL OF THIS DATA.  EVEN MORE DIFFICULT, I PLAN ON USING A SEPARATE CHASSIS WITH A SINGLE DIGITIZER IN IT JUST TO DO MY HIGHER SPEED DATA CAPTURE.  THIS SCHEME SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL TO CAPTURE THE DATA; I JUST NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SYNCHRONIZE IT. MOST OF THE SYNCHRONIZATION EXAMPLES I'VE FOUND ONLINE LOOKS LIKE THEY WORK THROUGH THE TRIGGER.  I'M USING A SOFTWARE TRIGGER SO I DON'T THINK THEY WILL WORK PROPERLY FOR MY APPLICATION. WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DO IS BE ABLE TO SEND OVER A TIMESTAMP FROM 1 DIGITIZER TO THE OTHERS ON THE OTHER CHASSIS.
